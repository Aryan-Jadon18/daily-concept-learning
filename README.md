# 📘 Daily Concept Learning

## 📖 Introduction
This repository is a collection of **daily notes, explanations, and examples** for new concepts across programming, computer science, and technology.  
The goal is to build a habit of **learning one new concept every day**, documenting it clearly, and creating a reference library for future use.

Whether you’re a student, developer, or lifelong learner, this repo serves as a **daily journal of continuous learning**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Learn and document **one new concept per day**.
- Provide **simple explanations** with examples.
- Explore concepts across multiple domains (web dev, cloud, ML, system design, etc.).
- Build a **knowledge base** that grows over time.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **Daily Concepts:** Each day’s concept stored in its respective folder (e.g., `Day01`, `Day02`).
- **Notes:** Markdown files explaining the concept in simple terms.
- **Examples:** Code snippets or diagrams to illustrate the concept.
- **Resources:** Links to helpful articles, tutorials, or documentation.
